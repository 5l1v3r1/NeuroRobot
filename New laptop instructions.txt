Download boost 1.69 from
https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_69_0.html
Unzip the boost_1_69_0 directory to C:\ (slow)

Download and install Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition with these Workloads selected during install: .NET desktop development, Desktop development with C++, Universal Windows Platform Development, ASP.Net and web development, Python development, Node.js development, Data storage and processing, Data science and analytical applications.
Note: This configuration is known to work but is probably overkill (28 GB). However, a straightforward install with only the Universal Windows Development Workload does not work (bootstrap build command below fails).

Use the Visual Studio developer command prompt to go to C:\boost_1_69_0
Run bootstrap.bat (this creates b2)
Run b2 (this builds all boost libraries, slow)
Not sure what parameters to use for b2, used address-model=64 here but not sure it matters
