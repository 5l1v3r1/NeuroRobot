Guidelines for building ffmpeg library

Clone ffmpeg:
`clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git`

~~ Windows ~~





~~ macOS ~~

Commands need to run in terminal from ffmpeg folder.
If you don't set `--prefix`, librart will be in `/usr/lib`
`./configure --enable-shared --disable-static --prefix=./install`
`make`
`make install`

notes:
- Libraries (*.dylib) must be in /usr/lib. So copy libraries from libraries/mac/ffmpeg/lib to /usr/lib.
- Followed https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/macOS
